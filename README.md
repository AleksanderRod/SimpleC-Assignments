## C++ Coding Assignments Summary

This repository contains various C++ coding assignments, showcasing different programming concepts, including recursion, binary search, and binary trees.

### 1. **Print Squares (Recursive Pattern Drawing)**
   - This program takes a size input (within the range of 5 to 20) and uses recursion to draw a pattern of squares made of 'X' characters. The program handles the drawing of rows and columns using recursion, effectively replacing the need for nested loops.
   - After drawing, the user is asked if they wish to run the program again.

### 2. **Binary Search Simulation**
   - This program simulates a binary search process. Given a search range (1 to 100,000) and a target value, it performs a binary search while displaying each step of the search range adjustment.
   - It informs the user whether the target was found ("GOT IT!") or not. The search logic follows the standard binary search algorithm but with additional tracing to show how the search range changes.

### 3. **Binary Tree Structure Comparison**
   - This program constructs binary search trees from two user-provided input sequences and compares the structure of these two trees.
   - The trees are built using a recursive insert function, and then a recursive function checks whether the two trees have the same structure (regardless of the node values).
   - The program outputs whether the trees have the "Same structure" or "Not same structure" based on the comparison.

Each of these assignments illustrates different C++ programming techniques, including recursion, binary search algorithms, dynamic memory allocation with pointers, and binary tree operations.
